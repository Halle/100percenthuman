**Politepix** is the company behind [OpenEars](https://politepix.com/openears), the first offline speech recognition engine and plugin platform for iOS, among many other things.

[**Halle**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hallewinkler/) is the 100% human owner of Politepix, and knows [a lot about writing, producing, releasing, and testing software for Apple development platforms](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hallewinkler/) because she's been doing it for ages. She's familiar enough with the platform that she [sometimes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102874) [locates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102853) [security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120950) [flaws](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121238) [in](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121564) [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121839) OSes to help get them fixed, just for fun. She likes to make all software work better, but she has a soft spot for high performance [audio/video](https://theoffcuts.org/posts/core-media-io-camera-extensions-part-three/) because she's one of those arty developers.

[**100% Human**](/) is Politepix's new thing: a fixed-time program for getting a missing piece into your production flow so that your software updates are smoother, your users happier, and you can sleep better. The first offering is a [six-week program to get a sustainable UI test suite in place for your product](/), so that increased feature velocity from coding assistants doesn't result in release surprises sneaking past your preflight checks. The idea is that a 100% Human can use their experience to make it safer for you to integrate code assistant code into your production flow, whether its arrival into your codebase is planned, or not.
